### **About the Server**

LuminarGame is not just a Minecraft server. It's a true world for players, where everyone can find something for themselves. Our server is based on the Vanilla Minecraft 1.20.1 version, but is equipped with top-tier plugins that make the game convenient, secure, and interesting. We value the comfort of every player, which is why we've done everything to ensure there are no lags, no errors, and no freezes.

Every day you can dive into a world with a fair economy, useful commands, land protection, and various helpful features that make life on the server more vibrant.

Our admin team consists of professionals who maintain order, enforce the rules, and are always ready to help. They will make sure your time on LuminarGame is as pleasant and safe as possible.
